## Case Studies: Technical Turnarounds

These deep dives illustrate my methodology in action—moving from operational chaos to technical stability.

### 1. Stabilizing Mission-Critical ERP Workflows

**The Challenge:** A major municipal government struggled with inefficiencies in their PeopleSoft Learning Management modules, facing high incident rates and regression risks. Communication between technical vendors and functional staff had broken down.

**The Strategy:**
* **Standardized Framework:** Implemented a formal regression testing protocol for city-wide use.
* **Technical Translation:** Scoped requirements that vendors could execute while meeting stakeholder needs.
* **Zero-Downtime Patching:** Established a protocol to ensure operational continuity during critical updates.

**The Result:** Delivered stable, optimized workflows for city-wide use, ensuring 100% uptime during critical patching cycles and a 40% reduction in post-launch incident reports.

### 2. Automating Lead Logistics with Python

**The Challenge:** A manual process for routing and logging leads was creating a 4-hour response delay, resulting in significant revenue leakage.

**The Strategy:**
* **Custom Application:** Developed a Python tool utilizing the Twilio API to handle incoming data.
* **Logic-Based Routing:** Built a filtering system to route leads automatically based on priority and availability.
* **CRM Integration:** Automated the logging process to ensure data integrity across the organization.

**The Result:** Reduced lead response time from 4 hours to 30 seconds. Transformed a high-touch process into a fully autonomous system, eliminating 90% of manual administrative overhead.
