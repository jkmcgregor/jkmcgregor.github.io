## Case Studies: Technical Turnarounds

These deep dives illustrate my methodology in action—moving from operational chaos to technical stability.

### 1. Stabilizing Mission-Critical ERP Workflows
**Client:** Major Municipal Government (PeopleSoft Environment)
**The Challenge:** High incident rates and regression risks in the Learning Management modules were causing city-wide operational delays. Communication between technical vendors and functional staff had broken down.

**The Strategy:** * Implemented a standardized regression testing framework.
* Acted as the "Technical Translator" to scope requirements that vendors could actually execute.
* Established a "Zero-Downtime" patching protocol.

**The Result:** 100% uptime during critical patching cycles and a 40% reduction in post-launch incident reports.

### 2. Automating Lead Logistics with Python
**The Challenge:** A manual process for routing and logging leads was creating a 4-hour response delay, resulting in significant revenue leakage.

**The Strategy:** * Developed a custom Python application utilizing the Twilio API.
* Built a logic-based filtering system to route leads based on priority and availability.
* Integrated automated logging into the client's existing CRM.

**The Result:** Reduced lead response time from 4 hours to 30 seconds. Eliminated 90% of manual administrative overhead.
