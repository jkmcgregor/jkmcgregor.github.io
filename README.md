**Stabilizing Mission-Critical ERP Workflows**
*The Problem:* A major municipal government struggled with inefficiencies in their PeopleSoft Learning Management modules, facing high incident rates and regression risks.
*The Bridge:* Acted as the translation layer between technical vendors and functional stakeholders, leading requirements scoping and execution of regression testing.
*The Result:* **Delivered stable, optimized workflows for city-wide use, reducing production errors and ensuring zero operational downtime during patching.**

**Eliminating Manual Labor with Python Automation**
*The Problem:* A client’s lead generation and routing process was entirely manual, creating bottlenecks and lost revenue due to slow response times.
*The Bridge:* Designed and deployed a custom Python application integrated with Twilio to automatically log, filter, and route incoming calls.
*The Result:* **Transformed a high-touch process into a fully autonomous system, reducing administrative overhead by 90% and ensuring instant lead capture.**

**Aligning C-Suite Vision with Technical Reality**
*The Problem:* A complex IT project was stalling because the development team’s output didn't match the executive board’s strategic goals.
