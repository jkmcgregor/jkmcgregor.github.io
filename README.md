## The "Bridge" Methodology
I specialize in fixing the unfixable. As a "Bridge" architect, I connect technical infrastructure with enterprise goals, ensuring that complex IT projects deliver actual business value.

### Core Competencies
* **Strategic Turnarounds:** Rescuing stalled ERP implementations and digital transformations.
* **Executive Translation:** Speaking both "Developer" and "C-Suite" to align diverse stakeholders.
* **Technical Pedigree:** A background in code (active since 2015) that grounds strategy in reality.
