## Consulting Services

I offer flexible engagement structures designed to fit the operational maturity and immediate needs of the organization.

### 1. Project Rescue & Turnaround
**The Focus:** Stabilization of stalled or high-friction IT initiatives.
<br>
**The Deliverable:** Assessment & Recovery Roadmap.
<br>
We begin with a 30-day diagnostic period to interview stakeholders, audit the backlog, and map the current process. I deliver a formal report that highlights specific bottlenecks and a prioritized roadmap to get the project moving again.

### 2. Fractional Program Direction
**The Focus:** Strategic oversight for organizations scaling their technical operations.
<br>
**The Deliverable:** Operational Cadence.
<br>
I step in to establish professional reporting standards and vendor accountability. I ensure that the C-Suite receives accurate, jargon-free updates on technical progress, acting as the translation layer between the board and the development team.

### 3. Technical Due Diligence
**The Focus:** Auditing the clarity and feasibility of your technical roadmap.
<br>
**The Deliverable:** The Health Check.
<br>
A standardized review of your development lifecycle and architectural risks. I compare your business goals against your technical reality to identify potential "scope creep" or resource gaps before they impact the bottom line.
