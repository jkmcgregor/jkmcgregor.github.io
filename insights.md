### Featured White Paper
**The Strategic Translation Layer: Closing the Value Gap in Enterprise IT**
*A Framework for Rescuing High-Stakes Technical Transformations.*

Enterprise IT projects fail at a staggering rate—not due to a lack of technical talent, but due to a "Translation Gap" between executive vision and engineering reality. 

**Key Insights from the Paper:**
* **The Diagnostic Audit:** How to identify "silent blockers" in ERP systems before they lead to operational delays.
* **Empowered Alignment:** Utilizing servant leadership and strengths-based principles to realign technical teams with business outcomes.
* **The Automation Mandate:** Why manual "workarounds" are your organization's biggest systemic liability.

### Why "Technical Literacy" is the Missing Link in IT Leadership

Many Program Directors manage via spreadsheet, but they cannot audit the reality of the work. Grounded in my background in Business Information Systems and my M.S. in Leadership, I believe that a leader who can read the code is a leader who can accurately assess risk.

**The 3 Signs Your Project is at Risk:**

1. **The "Status Green" Trap:** Everything looks good on the dashboard, but the technical debt is mounting.
2. **Translation Loss:** The C-Suite asks for a bridge; the developers are building a boat. 
3. **Manual Over-Reliance:** If your "automated" system requires four people to run it, it isn't a system—it's a liability.

### The ERP Rescue Checklist

Before you fire your vendor or scrap your implementation, ask these three questions:

* Is the data clean at the source?
* Are the functional requirements grounded in technical reality?
* Is there a documented regression testing plan?
