## Strategic Insights

Practical observations on the intersection of leadership, technology, and operational efficiency.

### Why "Technical Literacy" is the Missing Link in IT Leadership
Many Program Directors manage via spreadsheet, but they cannot audit the reality of the work. I believe that a leader who can read the code is a leader who can accurately assess risk.

**The 3 Signs Your Project is at Risk:**
1. **The "Status Green" Trap:** Everything looks good on the dashboard, but the technical debt is mounting.
2. **Translation Loss:** The C-Suite asks for a bridge; the developers are building a boat. 
3. **Manual Over-Reliance:** If your "automated" system requires four people to run it, it isn't a system—it's a liability.

### The ERP Rescue Checklist
Before you fire your vendor or scrap your implementation, ask these three questions:
* Is the data clean at the source?
* Are the functional requirements grounded in technical reality?
* Is there a documented regression testing plan?
